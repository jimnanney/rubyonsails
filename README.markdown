Ruby On Sails Call For Proposals
--------------------------------

This is the repository where the Ruby On Sails call for proposals app will be hosted.

Originally set to use the Ruby Central CFP app, this should be much lighter weight and less cumbersome.

Thanks to @envygeeks for all the hard work!

To setup, you'll need a GitHub Application Key and Secret.
